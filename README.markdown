Pail
====

Pail is a programming language based on pairs; just as Lisp stands for
*LIS*t *P*rocessing, Pail stands for *PAI*r *L*anguage.

This is the reference distribution for Pail.

The Pail programming language is documented in the literate source code
of its reference interpreter, `Pail.lhs`, which can be found in the `src`
subdirectory.  Some tests, in Falderal format, which might clarify the
intended behaviour can also be found in `Pail.markdown` in the `tests`
subdirectory.

These files are distributed under a 3-clause BSD license.  See the file
`LICENSE` for the license text.

For more information on the language, see the [Pail][] entry at
Cat's Eye Technologies.
